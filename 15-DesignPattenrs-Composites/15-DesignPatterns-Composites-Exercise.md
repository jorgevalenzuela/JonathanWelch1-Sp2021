# Exercise: Design Patterns: Composites

## Tasks

In `Folder.cs`, implement the `search` method that, given a relative path (e.g., 
"F/b.txt") file/folder/shortcut, it retrieves the `Entry` object associated with
the path.

When implemented correctly, all unit tests under `FileSystemTests.cs` should
pass.
