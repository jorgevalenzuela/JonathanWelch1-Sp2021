# Exercise: Storage and Object Diagrams

## Tasks

Play with the app under `04-Storage-Object-Diagrams-Perms`, 
say, input: `abc`   then   `de`   then   `fghi`   then ...

1. Insert a breakpoint at the marked position in `Main` of `Program.cs`.  
   Start the debugger and enter your inputs again;
   Study the debug information each time the breakpoint is reached.

   Now, draw a storage diagram (in LucidChart) at the breakpoint you reach 
   after your first two inputs.
   Draw your diagram to look like the ones in the lecture note.

2. Draw an object diagram from your storage diagram.
   (The object diagram has less detail, and it summarizes what the heap looks 
   like after the programming has been running for a while.)
   
3. Use `Json.NET` to print the textual form of `d` before the breakpoint at
   the marked position in `Main` (see the lecture note on how to do this).

## Submission

Submit your diagram(s) copy the folder containing this file to your
local GitHub repository for the course, and then commit and push your modified
solutions to GitHub.
